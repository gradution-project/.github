#  Student Information System | Graduation Project | 2022

## Summary
For my graduation project, I developed an innovative Student Information System that can meet all the needs of students/teachers/student affairs at a university and make their lives easier. I used Jira and GitHub for project management, NeXT.js and TailwindCSS for front-end development, Java17, Spring Boot and Maven for back-end development and MySQL and FlyWay for database management.For my graduation project, I developed an innovative Student Information System that can meet all the needs of students/teachers/student affairs at a university and make their lives easier.
